#qmk-to-kmk-translator
This was a quick and dirty hack to speed up keymap dev while using KMK firmware.
Ther is only one keyboard class created so far, and it will work for the atreus62.
I do plan on creating more classes as my projects require, but also look forward 
to seeing what other people do with it.

Right now the key lookup table needs to be expanded, as it is basically tailored
to my Warhorse64 project.
